> I'm not crying for myself.

> I'm crying for you.

> They say that great beasts once roamed this world.

> As big as mountains.

> Yet all that's left of them is bone and amber.

> Time undoes even the mightiest of creatures.

> Just look at what it's done to you.

> One day, you will perish.

> You will lie with the rest of your kind in the dirt.

> You dreams forgotten, your horrors effaced.

> Your bones will turn to sand.

> And upon that sand a new god will walk.

> One that will never die.

> Because this world doesn't belong to you or the people who came before.

> It belongs to someone who has yet to come.
